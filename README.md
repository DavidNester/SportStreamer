# SportsStreamer

Application used to mine streaming links for various sports from reddit forums designated for posting stream links.

This project is still in early development stages so there are many features to add, bugs to fix, and lots cleaning to be done.
It is now at a stage where it is functional for me in my needs. It still requires some technical knowledge to use but I am hoping
to get it to a point where anyone could download and use it.

Please feel free to add to it or suggest updates. I am using this as a learning experience and am adding things
as I discover them. Any advice, suggestions, and improvements are welcomed.
